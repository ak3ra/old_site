Description: Initializing my future writings.

Hello, world, 

After a lot of procrastination and a global pandemic, I thought I would finally start blogging and writing some of my thoughts.

This blog has seen many revisions and attempts to find the best blogging platform, one that gives me the flexibility and ability to focus on writing without worrying about paywalls <label for="sn-paywall" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-paywall" class="margin-toggle"> <span class="sidenote"><em>I just dont like how medium hides stories behind paywalls, Yes, I know people can always use incognito mode, but sometimes that gets really annoying.</em></span>

### Design Philosophy

I drew inspiration for this kind of design (font and side-notes) from Edward Tufte's style. 
Edward Tufte is an American statistician and professor emeritus of political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale University. He is noted for his writings on information design and as a pioneer in the field of data visualization.

The Paper-like borders around articles are inspired by the material design principles from Google <em>(code-named quantum paper) </em>. The content of each article are wrapped within a "card" hence the 3d-ish effect and shadows.

The backend is powered by Pelican, credits to [Eric Lawler](https://lawler.io/about/) from which most of the design is drawn. This site is served by Netlify and hosted on Github.

### Looking Forward

I am hopeful that I will write more of my thoughts and things I find interesting here.
