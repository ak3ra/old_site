Hello, world, 

Init <label for="sn-technically" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-technically" class="margin-toggle"> 
<span class="sidenote"><em>Init [init: ] In Unix-based computer operating systems, init (short for initialization) is the first process started during booting of the computer system. Init is a daemon process that continues running until the system is shut down.</em>
 </span> After many years of procrastination and a global pandemic, I thought I would finally start blogging and writing some of my thoughts. The internet is now full of very many blogging platforms, but somehow the simplicity of blogger still stands out. 

With most platforms either too complicated to set up (Hugo, Jekyll) or hiding content behind paywalls (Medium). I thought I would go back to my roots and just write here. 
I will write mainly around random thoughts, ideas and things I am learning. 

Hope this works out.
