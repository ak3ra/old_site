I am currently a research intern at the MILA - Quebec AI Institute where I am working with the Humanitarian AI group under the supervision of Prof. Yoshua Bengio.My research interests lie broadly on the ways we can use machine learning for social good, to solve some of the challenging problems the world is facing right now. 


Currently, I am working on ways we can use computer vision to measure and mitigate the reverse effects of climate change in the Hindu-Kush-Himalayas region.

Before I joined MILA, I worked with the Makerere University AI Research group in Uganda to utilize machine learning models in creating solutions to problems in Agriculture and public health.
